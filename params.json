Do you think that changing your wallpaper is a daunting task? Then Snappr is made for you, as it automatically changes the wallpaper of your Mac from the images posted on the subreddits you have chosen. \r\n\r\nIt only uses images with the appropriate resolution (and it’s fully compatible with Retina Macs) so you don’t end up with a pixelated background in a high-resolution screen.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it avoids repeating the same image in order to have a fresh work environment.\r\n","google":"UA-30886522-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
